# Scalability Strategy

This document outlines the scalability strategy for the `roborail-assistant` project, focusing on how the architecture, leveraging Encore, and application design choices contribute to handling increased load and data.

## Encore's Role in Scalability

The project is built using Encore, a backend development platform that significantly simplifies and automates infrastructure management, including aspects of scalability:

1.  **Microservice Architecture:** Encore promotes a microservice architecture. Services are designed to be independent and can be scaled individually based on their specific load. This is fundamental to horizontal scalability.

2.  **Automated Provisioning & Scaling (Encore Cloud):** When deployed using Encore Cloud:
    *   **Service Instances:** Encore automatically manages the provisioning and auto-scaling of service instances in response to traffic and resource utilization.
    *   **Managed Databases:** Encore integrates with managed database services (e.g., PostgreSQL on AWS/GCP). These services typically offer their own scalability features, such as storage auto-scaling, and options for read replicas, which Encore orchestrates.

3.  **Infrastructure as Code (Abstracted):** Encore abstracts away much of the traditional infrastructure-as-code complexity. Developers define logical resources (like databases, caches, pub/sub topics), and Encore handles provisioning the underlying physical infrastructure in a cloud-agnostic or cloud-optimized manner.

## Application-Level Contributions to Scalability

While Encore handles much of the infrastructure scaling, the application's design is crucial for achieving overall scalability:

1.  **Stateless Services:**
    *   Backend services (`chat`, `docmgmt`, `upload`, `docprocessing`, `search`) are designed to be stateless wherever possible. This allows Encore to effectively scale them horizontally by adding more instances without concerns about session affinity or shared instance-specific state.
    *   Session state or temporary user data, if needed, should be offloaded to a shared distributed cache or database.

2.  **Efficient Caching (`docs/caching-strategy.md`):
    *   A multi-level caching strategy is implemented using Encore's caching primitives (refer to the [Caching Strategy document](mdc:docs/caching-strategy.md) for details).
    *   This reduces load on databases and backend services by serving frequently accessed data from a faster cache, significantly improving response times and overall system throughput.

3.  **Database Optimization (`docs/database-optimization.md`):
    *   Critical database queries are optimized, and appropriate indexes are implemented (refer to the [Database Optimization Strategy document](mdc:docs/database-optimization.md) for details).
    *   This ensures that the database, often a bottleneck in scalable systems, performs efficiently under load.

4.  **Asynchronous Processing:**
    *   Operations like document processing (chunking, embedding) are designed to be asynchronous (e.g., triggered via an API call which then returns, while the processing happens in the background, or via a Pub/Sub mechanism if implemented).
    *   This prevents long-running tasks from blocking user-facing APIs and allows these background tasks to be scaled independently if needed (e.g., through a worker service pattern orchestrated by Encore).

## Database Scalability Considerations

*   **Logical vs. Physical Schema:** The application defines its logical database schema using Drizzle ORM (`backend/db/schema.ts`).
*   **Managed Service Features:** Physical database scalability aspects such as:
    *   **Read Replicas:** To offload read traffic.
    *   **Connection Pooling:** Managed by Encore and the database driver.
    *   **Instance Sizing & Storage Scaling:** Handled by the managed database service, often with auto-scaling capabilities.
    are primarily features of the managed database service (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL) that Encore Cloud utilizes. Developers typically don't configure these directly in application code but might influence choices through Encore Cloud settings if available.
*   **Sharding & Partitioning:**
    *   **Application-Transparent Sharding:** For extreme scalability, database sharding (horizontal partitioning across multiple database instances) might be required. This is a complex undertaking typically managed at the infrastructure and database layers. If Encore Cloud supports or automates sharding for its managed databases, that would be the preferred approach.
    *   **Table Partitioning (within a single DB instance):** PostgreSQL offers table partitioning (e.g., by range or list). While Drizzle defines the schema, implementing and managing table partitions is an advanced database administration task. It could be beneficial for very large tables (e.g., `document_chunks`, `conversation_messages`) to improve query performance and maintenance. This would involve specific DDL in migrations and careful query design. Currently, this level of partitioning is not explicitly implemented in the Drizzle schema but could be considered if specific tables become performance bottlenecks due to size.

## Self-Hosting Encore

If the application were to be self-hosted (rather than using Encore Cloud):
*   **Service Scaling:** Would require manual configuration of a container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes with Horizontal Pod Autoscalers).
*   **Database Scaling:** Would involve manually setting up and managing database replication, potentially sharding/clustering solutions (e.g., Patroni, CitusData for PostgreSQL), and configuring backups and failover.
*   These are significant operational responsibilities that Encore Cloud aims to abstract.

## Conclusion

The scalability strategy relies on Encore's robust infrastructure management combined with application design best practices (stateless services, caching, query optimization, asynchronous processing). This approach allows developers to focus on business logic while benefiting from a scalable underlying platform. Further scaling needs, especially around database sharding or advanced partitioning, would be addressed in conjunction with Encore's capabilities and the chosen cloud provider's offerings.
