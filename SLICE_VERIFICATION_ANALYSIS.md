### 🔄 PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

#### Slice 9: Frontend Chat UI
- **Status**: Backend APIs ready, frontend structure exists but needs completion
- **Missing**: Complete Next.js chat interface with Shadcn UI components

#### Slice 10-11: Document Management UI
- **Status**: Backend APIs implemented, frontend needs development
- **Missing**: Upload UI, document list/management interface

#### Slice 15: Advanced Conversation Features
- **Status**: Backend foundation exists, some features need completion
- **Missing**: Auto-save drafts, follow-up question generation

### ❌ NEEDS ATTENTION

#### Test Failures
- Some tests failing due to environment setup issues
- Database connection tests need Redis/DB setup
- Mock configuration needs refinement

#### Frontend Implementation
- Chat UI components need completion
- Document upload/management interfaces
- Citation hover cards and interactive elements
