# Active Context & Next Steps

**Current Major Focus:** Project Completion

**Current Taskmaster Task ID:** N/A - All tasks completed.

**Immediate Next Steps:**
*   Review overall project status and documentation.
*   Prepare for final review or handoff if applicable.

**Pending Clarifications:**
*   None at this time.

**Key Learnings/Decisions from last session:**
*   Completed Task 15 and all its subtasks, focusing on deployment readiness (config/secrets management, understanding Encore's auto-scaling, and defining monitoring/alerting strategies).
*   All project tasks in Taskmaster have been marked as 'done'.

## Current Project Status
**RAG Chat Application - Enterprise Knowledge Management Platform**

The project has completed **database schema implementation** and **cancelled authentication** (not needed for this app). Ready to start **document upload and processing service**.

## Current Focus
- **Infrastructure Setup**: ‚úÖ Task 1 completed - Full project structure, CI/CD, and dev environment ready
- **Database Schema & ORM**: ‚úÖ Task 2 completed - PGVector integration, Drizzle ORM, 13/13 tests passing
- **Authentication System**: ‚ùå Task 3 cancelled - Authentication not needed for this app
- **Document Processing**: üéØ Task 4 ready - File upload, storage, and processing pipeline
- **Code Quality**: ‚úÖ Formatting, linting, and pre-commit hooks established

## Implementation Strategy Overview

### Vertical Slices Approach (15 Slices Total)
1. **Slices 1-3**: Core backend foundation, database schema, document upload, basic processing
2. **Slices 4-6**: Embedding generation, storage, basic search, hybrid search with reranking
3. **Slices 7-9**: Chat service, RAG agent, LLM integration, basic frontend chat UI
4. **Slices 10-11**: Document management UI, upload interface, document CRUD operations
5. **Slices 12-13**: Testing strategy (Vitest + DeepEval), caching implementation (Redis)
6. **Slices 14-15**: Production configuration, monitoring, advanced conversation features

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Parse PRD into Tasks**: Use Task Master's parse-prd functionality to generate actionable tasks
2. **Begin Slice 1**: Core backend foundation and database schema setup
3. **Environment Setup**: Configure development environment with all required services
4. **Initial Implementation**: Start with EncoreTS project structure and NeonDB setup

## Key Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture
- **Backend**: EncoreTS microservices with built-in infrastructure
- **Database**: NeonDB (PostgreSQL + PGVector) with Drizzle ORM
- **AI Stack**: Mastra AI + Cohere + Gemini + Unstructured.io
- **Frontend**: Next.js + Shadcn UI + Tanstack Query
- **Testing**: Vitest + DeepEval for RAG-specific evaluations

### Quality Standards
- **File Size**: <500 lines per file for maintainability
- **Security**: All secrets via Encore secrets, no hardcoding
- **Testing**: TDD approach with 80%+ coverage
- **Modularity**: Feature-based organization with clear interfaces

## Current Blockers
None identified. Ready to proceed with task generation and implementation.

## Recent Achievements
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive PRD created with detailed requirements
- ‚úÖ 15 implementation slices defined with technical specifications
- ‚úÖ Memory bank fully updated with project context
- ‚úÖ Task Master project initialized
- ‚úÖ Technical architecture and patterns documented

## Dependencies & External Services
- **NeonDB**: PostgreSQL database with PGVector extension
- **Cohere API**: Embeddings (embed-v4.0) and reranking
- **Google Gemini API**: LLM for response generation
- **Unstructured.io API**: Document parsing and processing
- **Redis**: Caching layer for performance optimization
- **DeepEval API**: RAG evaluation and testing

Current Task ID: 12
Task Title: Implement Comprehensive Testing Framework
Status: Pending

Focus: Set up unit, integration, and RAG evaluation tests. This includes configuring Vitest for different test types (unit/integration) and integrating DeepEval for semantic similarity and LLM rubric testing. The goal is to enforce TDD and achieve >80% test coverage.

Next Steps (Subtasks of 12):
1.  **12.1**: Configure Vitest for Unit and Integration Testing (create separate configs, workspace projects, npm scripts).
2.  **12.2**: Implement RAG Evaluation Testing with DeepEval (install, create fixtures/datasets, implement metrics).
3.  **12.3**: Establish Test Coverage Monitoring and TDD Workflow (configure coverage reporting, CI/CD integration, TDD docs, pre-commit hooks).

Previous Task ID: 11 (and its subtasks 11.1, 11.2, 11.3)
Task Title: Implement Monitoring and Observability
Status: Done
Summary: 
- 11.1: Implemented custom metrics instrumentation (conceptual, to be handled by Encore).
- 11.2: Set up structured logging using `encore.dev/log`, refactoring `chat.ts`.
- 11.3: Documented monitoring dashboard strategy (`docs/observability/dashboards.md`) covering Encore dev dashboard usage, key metrics/logs, conceptual production dashboards, and alerting.
