## Technical Decisions Made

### Core Architecture
- **Backend Framework**: EncoreTS for microservices with built-in infrastructure
- **Database**: NeonDB (PostgreSQL + PGVector) with Drizzle ORM
- **AI Orchestration**: Mastra AI for workflows and agent management
- **LLM**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for response generation
- **Embeddings**: Cohere embed-v4.0 (multimodal)
- **Document Processing**: Unstructured.io for PDF/DOCX parsing

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **UI Library**: Shadcn UI with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Tanstack Query for server state
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout

### Quality & Testing
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest for unit/integration tests
