# Task ID: 8
# Title: Build Chat Service and RAG Agent Orchestration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop ChatService for conversation management and RAG agent orchestration.
# Details:
Manage chat conversations (create, resume, auto-save drafts). Orchestrate RAG agent for contextual, cited responses. Support history pruning and intelligent context management.

# Test Strategy:
Test conversation management, RAG orchestration, and context management. Validate auto-save and history pruning.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Conversation Management (Creation and Resumption) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement mechanisms for creating new conversations and resuming existing ones, ensuring proper state persistence and retrieval.
### Details:
Define conversation data models, endpoints for creation and resumption, and ensure conversations are uniquely identifiable and retrievable.

## 2. RAG Agent Orchestration for Contextual Responses [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Integrate and orchestrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agents to provide contextual responses within conversations, managing the flow between search, retrieval, and LLM components.
### Details:
Implement workflow to retrieve relevant context, invoke LLMs, and maintain conversation state across agent interactions.

## 3. Draft Auto-Save Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement auto-save for message drafts within conversations, ensuring users do not lose progress and can resume unfinished messages.
### Details:
Design draft storage, trigger auto-save events, and provide retrieval endpoints for draft restoration.

## 4. History Pruning and Context Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Develop mechanisms to prune conversation history and manage context windows, optimizing performance and ensuring relevant context is maintained for RAG workflows.
### Details:
Implement logic for history truncation, context window management, and efficient retrieval of relevant past messages.
