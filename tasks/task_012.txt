# Title: Implement Comprehensive Testing Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up unit, integration, and RAG evaluation tests with DeepEval.
# Details:
Configure Vitest for unit/integration tests. Integrate DeepEval for semantic similarity and LLM rubric testing. Enforce TDD for core components. Target >80% test coverage.

# Test Strategy:
Test test framework setup, coverage, and RAG evaluation. Validate TDD workflow.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Vitest for Unit and Integration Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up separate configurations for unit and integration tests using Vitest
### Details:
Create vitest.config.unit.ts and vitest.config.integration.ts files. Configure unit tests to exclude integration test files. Set up workspace projects to separate test types. Add appropriate npm scripts for running each test type separately.

## 2. Implement RAG Evaluation Testing with DeepEval [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up DeepEval for testing and evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation components
### Details:
Install DeepEval package. Create test fixtures and evaluation datasets. Implement metrics for measuring RAG quality (relevance, faithfulness, context precision). Configure test environment for RAG components.

## 3. Establish Test Coverage Monitoring and TDD Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Set up test coverage tools and implement Test-Driven Development practices
### Details:
Configure code coverage reporting in Vitest. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing. Create documentation for TDD workflow. Implement pre-commit hooks to enforce test coverage thresholds. Set up dashboards for monitoring test metrics over time.
