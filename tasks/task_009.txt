# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Caching Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up multi-level caching (in-memory + Redis) for embeddings and frequent queries.
# Details:
Integrate Redis and in-memory caching for embeddings and search results. Monitor and optimize cache hit rate (target >80%).

# Test Strategy:
Test caching integration, hit rate, and invalidation. Validate performance impact.

# Subtasks:
## 1. In-memory Caching Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and configure an in-memory (local) cache layer (L1 cache) within the application to store frequently accessed data for fast retrieval.
### Details:
Define cache size, eviction policies (e.g., LRU), and data serialization methods. Ensure thread safety and minimal latency for cache access. Integrate cache invalidation mechanisms to prevent stale data.

## 2. Redis Integration for Distributed Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Integrate Redis as a distributed (L2) cache to provide high availability and scalability across multiple application instances.
### Details:
Configure Redis connection settings, data serialization, and cache key strategies. Implement logic for cache reads/writes: check L1 cache first, then L2 (Redis), and finally the database if needed. Ensure cache consistency and implement cache invalidation/update strategies across both layers.

## 3. Cache Monitoring and Optimization for Target Hit Rates [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Implement monitoring and analytics for both cache layers to track hit/miss rates and optimize cache configuration for desired performance.
### Details:
Set up metrics collection (e.g., using Prometheus, Grafana, or Redis monitoring tools) to observe cache usage patterns. Analyze hit/miss rates, identify bottlenecks, and adjust cache sizes, eviction policies, or data partitioning to achieve target hit rates. Regularly review and refine cache invalidation strategies to minimize stale data.
