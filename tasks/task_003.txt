# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement User Authentication and Access Control
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop authentication middleware and access control logic for all endpoints.
# Details:
Integrate authentication provider (e.g., OAuth2, JWT). Implement user-scoped access to conversations and documents. Enforce HTTPS, input sanitization, and least privilege access. Store API keys via Encore secrets.

# Test Strategy:
Test authentication flow, access control, and secret management. Validate input sanitization and HTTPS enforcement.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Authentication Provider Integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate a secure authentication provider (such as OAuth, SAML, or OpenID Connect) into the application to handle user identity verification and login flows.
### Details:
Select an appropriate authentication provider based on system requirements. Implement the necessary SDKs or APIs, configure callback URLs, and ensure secure handling of authentication tokens.

## 2. User-Scoped Access Control Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement user-scoped access control to ensure that authenticated users can only access resources and actions permitted by their roles or permissions.
### Details:
Define user roles and permissions. Enforce access control checks at the API and service layers, ensuring that each request is authorized based on the authenticated user's scope.

## 3. Security Hardening (HTTPS, Input Sanitization) [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Apply security best practices such as enforcing HTTPS for all communications and sanitizing all user inputs to prevent common vulnerabilities.
### Details:
Configure HTTPS using valid certificates. Implement input validation and sanitization routines to protect against injection attacks and other input-based vulnerabilities.

## 4. API Key and Secrets Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Establish secure management of API keys and secrets, including storage, rotation, and access policies.
### Details:
Use a secrets management solution (such as AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault) to securely store and manage API keys and sensitive credentials. Implement access controls and regular rotation policies.
