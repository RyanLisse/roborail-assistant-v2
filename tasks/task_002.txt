# Task ID: 2
# Title: Define Database Schema and ORM Setup
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement NeonDB (PostgreSQL) schema with PGVector extension and configure Drizzle ORM.
# Details:
Define tables: documents, document_chunks, conversations, conversation_messages. Set up PGVector for vector storage with HNSW indexing. Configure Drizzle ORM for CRUD operations. Implement migrations and seeding scripts.

# Test Strategy:
Test schema creation, migrations, and basic CRUD operations. Validate vector storage and indexing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Schema Design for All Required Tables [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the database schema by defining all necessary tables, columns, data types, relationships, and constraints based on application requirements. Ensure normalization, minimize redundancy, and optimize for query patterns.
### Details:
Consider best practices such as using at least third normal form, establishing naming conventions, and including appropriate constraints. Document the schema structure and rationale for design choices.

## 2. PGVector Extension Configuration for Vector Storage [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Install and configure the PGVector extension in PostgreSQL to enable efficient storage and querying of vector data types required for AI or similarity search features.
### Details:
Ensure the extension is enabled in the database, and update the schema to include vector columns where needed. Document configuration steps and any required permissions or settings.

## 3. Drizzle ORM Integration and Model Definition [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Integrate Drizzle ORM into the application and define models that accurately represent the database schema, including support for vector fields and relationships.
### Details:
Map all tables and columns to ORM models, ensuring type safety and alignment with the schema. Implement any necessary custom types or adapters for vector fields.

## 4. Migration and Seeding Script Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Develop migration scripts to create and update the database schema, and implement seeding scripts to populate the database with initial or test data.
### Details:
Ensure migrations handle vector columns and constraints. Seeding scripts should use Drizzle ORM models and cover all required tables for development and testing.
