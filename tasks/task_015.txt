# Task ID: 15
# Title: Prepare for Deployment and Continuous Improvement
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Finalize deployment strategy and prepare for iterative enhancement.
# Details:
Configure environment-specific secrets and settings. Set up resource auto-scaling. Prepare for monitoring and alerting from day one. Plan for iterative feature enhancement and quality focus.

# Test Strategy:
Test deployment pipeline, environment configuration, and monitoring setup. Validate readiness for production.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Environment-specific Configuration and Secrets Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and manage environment-specific configurations and securely handle secrets (such as API keys, database credentials, and environment variables) for all deployment environments (development, staging, production). Ensure secrets are not hardcoded and are stored using secure vaults or secret management tools.
### Details:
This includes defining configuration files for each environment, integrating with secret management solutions, and validating that sensitive data is not exposed in code repositories.

## 2. Resource Auto-scaling Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Configure auto-scaling for compute, storage, and other resources to ensure the application can handle varying loads efficiently. Set up scaling policies and thresholds based on key performance metrics.
### Details:
This involves defining scaling rules, testing auto-scaling behavior under load, and ensuring that scaling events do not disrupt service availability.

## 3. Monitoring and Alerting Configuration for Production Readiness [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for all production systems. Define key metrics, set up dashboards, and configure actionable alerts to ensure rapid detection and response to incidents.
### Details:
This includes integrating with monitoring tools, establishing alert thresholds, and ensuring on-call procedures are in place for incident response.
