# Task ID: 15
# Title: Prepare for Deployment and Continuous Improvement
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Finalize deployment strategy and prepare for iterative enhancement.
# Details:
Configure environment-specific secrets and settings. Set up resource auto-scaling. Prepare for monitoring and alerting from day one. Plan for iterative feature enhancement and quality focus.

# Test Strategy:
Test deployment pipeline, environment configuration, and monitoring setup. Validate readiness for production.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Environment-specific Configuration and Secrets Management [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and manage environment-specific configurations and securely handle secrets (such as API keys, database credentials, and environment variables) for all deployment environments (development, staging, production). Ensure secrets are not hardcoded and are stored using secure vaults or secret management tools.
### Details:
This includes defining configuration files for each environment, integrating with secret management solutions, and validating that sensitive data is not exposed in code repositories.

# Environment-specific Configuration and Secrets Management Plan

## Review Phase
1. **Review Codebase:**
   * Identify hardcoded configuration values that should be environment-specific (LLM model names, RAG parameters)
   * Verify all secrets are properly managed (UnstructuredApiKey already using Encore secrets)

## Implementation Phase
2. **Encore Configuration Implementation:**
   * Define configuration structs using `encore.dev/config` for non-sensitive settings
   * Implement proper configuration access patterns

3. **Secrets Management Verification:**
   * Confirm UnstructuredApiKey uses `secrets.NewSecret()` and proper access methods
   * Apply consistent pattern for any additional secrets identified

4. **Environment Files Setup:**
   * Create/update `.env.example` with placeholders for required secrets
   * Verify `.env` is properly excluded in `.gitignore`

## Documentation Phase
5. **Create Configuration Management Documentation:**
   * Document Encore configuration usage and patterns
   * Detail secrets management procedures and best practices
   * Provide setup instructions for local development
   * Establish clear policy against hardcoding sensitive information

The focus will be primarily on documentation and verification of existing practices, with implementation work only if gaps are identified during review.

## 2. Resource Auto-scaling Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Configure auto-scaling for compute, storage, and other resources to ensure the application can handle varying loads efficiently. Set up scaling policies and thresholds based on key performance metrics.
### Details:
This involves defining scaling rules, testing auto-scaling behavior under load, and ensuring that scaling events do not disrupt service availability.

# Task Outcome: Resource Auto-scaling Setup (Encore Context)

1. **Documentation Review:** The existing `docs/scalability-strategy.md` (created in Task 14.3) was reviewed. It sufficiently explains Encore's role in automating resource auto-scaling for services and databases, and how application design (statelessness, caching, async processing) supports this.

2. **Encore's Abstraction:** Confirmed that direct configuration of auto-scaling policies and thresholds (e.g., CPU utilization targets for scaling, min/max instance counts for services, or detailed storage scaling rules for databases) is primarily handled by the Encore platform (especially Encore Cloud) and the underlying managed cloud services it uses. These are not typically configured via application code in an Encore project.

3. **No Code Changes:** No application code changes were necessary for this subtask, as auto-scaling is an infrastructure concern managed by Encore.

4. **Conclusion:** The task of "Resource Auto-scaling Setup" in an Encore context translates to ensuring the application is designed to leverage Encore's inherent scalability and documenting this approach. This has been achieved through prior tasks and the existing `scalability-strategy.md`.

## 3. Monitoring and Alerting Configuration for Production Readiness [done]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for all production systems. Define key metrics, set up dashboards, and configure actionable alerts to ensure rapid detection and response to incidents.
### Details:
This includes integrating with monitoring tools, establishing alert thresholds, and ensuring on-call procedures are in place for incident response.

# Monitoring and Alerting Configuration Plan

## 1. Key Metrics for Monitoring & Alerting

### System-Level Metrics (Encore/Cloud Managed)
- Service CPU/Memory utilization
- API Gateway latency and error rates
- Database metrics: CPU, Memory, Storage, Connection counts
- Cache performance: Hit/miss ratios, Memory usage

### Application-Specific Metrics
- Chat functionality: Average response time (SLA <3s), RAG processing time, Error rates
- Document Processing: Throughput, Average processing time (SLA <5min), Failure rates
- Upload functionality: Success/failure rates, Average upload time
- General: API endpoint error rates and latencies

## 2. Encore Observability Integration
- Leverage structured logs from Task 13.1 for error detection and metric derivation
- Utilize distributed traces for latency analysis and bottleneck identification
- Implement Encore Cloud dashboards for built-in metrics visualization

## 3. Alerting Strategy
- Critical Errors: Configure alerts for spikes in 5xx errors and high service error rates
- SLA Breaches: Set up notifications when chat responses exceed 3s or document processing exceeds 5min
- Resource Saturation: Alert on high CPU/Memory usage for services and database
- Processing Failures: Monitor and alert on elevated failure rates for document and chat processing

## 4. Dashboarding Approach
- Primary: Utilize Encore Cloud built-in dashboards
- Secondary: Note potential for exporting Encore data to external tools like Grafana/Datadog for custom dashboards (implementation out of scope)

## 5. Documentation Deliverable
- Create `docs/monitoring-alerting-strategy.md` documenting:
  - Key metrics (system & application)
  - Alerting strategy (triggers, targets)
  - Encore observability features usage
  - Dashboarding approach
  - Brief mention of on-call procedures requirement

## Expected Outcome
This subtask will deliver the monitoring and alerting strategy documentation. The actual configuration of alerts and dashboards in cloud platforms will be handled as part of deployment operations.
