# Multi-level Caching Implementation (using Encore Cache)

1. **Define Cache Cluster & Keyspaces (Encore):**
   * In `backend/lib/infrastructure/cache/cache.ts` (or `shared/` equivalent), define a global cache cluster using `cache.NewCluster`.
   * Define type-safe keyspaces (e.g., for conversations, document metadata) with appropriate `KeyPattern`, `Key` type, `Value` type, and `DefaultExpiry` (TTL).

2. **Create Cache Utility Service:**
   * In `backend/lib/cache/cache.service.ts` (or `shared/`), create a service that wraps the Encore keyspaces.
   * Methods like `getCachedObject(keyspace, key)`, `setCachedObject(keyspace, key, value, ttl?)`, `deleteCachedObject(keyspace, key)`.

3. **Implement Caching in Target Services:**
   * **`chat/conversation-management.ts` (`getConversationDetails`):**
     * Check cache using `CacheService` before DB query.
     * Store in cache after DB query.
     * Invalidate on `addMessage` (update) and conversation deletion.
   * **`docmgmt/documents.ts` (`getDocument`):**
     * Check cache for document metadata before DB query.
     * Store in cache after DB query.
     * Invalidate on `updateDocument` and `deleteDocument`.
   * Identify and implement for other high-impact areas as feasible.

4. **Cache Invalidation Strategy:**
   * Primarily rely on TTL defined in `KeyspaceConfig`.
   * Implement explicit cache deletion via `CacheService` upon data modification (update/delete operations in services).

5. **Documentation:**
   * Update/create `docs/caching-strategy.md` detailing the Encore cache setup, cluster/keyspace definitions, key conventions, and invalidation logic.

## 2. Query Optimization for Key Operations [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze and optimize critical database queries to improve performance
### Details:
Perform query plan analysis, implement proper indexing strategies, rewrite complex queries, and apply appropriate optimization techniques (cost-based, rule-based, or heuristic-based) based on query complexity. Focus on columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.
<info added on 2025-05-27T23:24:27.074Z>
# Query Optimization Plan

## 1. Identify Key Queries
- Review database-intensive operations in:
  - `chat/conversation-management.ts` (focus on `listConversations`, `getConversation`)
  - `docmgmt/documents.ts` (focus on `getDocuments`)
  - `docprocessing/processing.ts` (focus on `storeChunksInDatabase`)

## 2. Analysis (Conceptual)
- Examine query structures for complexity (joins, subqueries, `LIKE` on unindexed fields)
- Identify columns for indexing based on `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY` clauses

## 3. Optimization & Implementation
- **Indexing (Primary Focus):** Propose and implement new indexes in `backend/db/schema.ts`
  - `conversations`: on `(userId, updatedAt)`
  - `conversationMessages`: on `(conversationId, createdAt)`
  - `documents`: on `(userId, status)`, `(userId, contentType)`, `(userId, uploadedAt)`
  - Consider functional indexes for `LOWER(filename)` if `ILIKE` is heavily used
  - `documentChunks`: on `(documentId, chunkIndex)`
- **Query Refinement:** Review `listConversations` and `getDocuments` for potential simplification
- **Batch Operations:** Verify `storeChunksInDatabase` uses Drizzle's batch insert

## 4. Documentation
- Create `docs/database-optimization.md` detailing:
  - Identified queries
  - Analysis results
  - Implemented/proposed optimizations (especially indexes)

## 3. Auto-scaling Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2
### Description: Implement database sharding and partitioning with auto-scaling capabilities
### Details:
Design horizontal and vertical partitioning strategies, implement effective sharding for large databases, configure partition pruning, and set up auto-scaling rules based on performance metrics and traffic patterns.

# Auto-scaling Configuration (Encore Context)

## Implementation Plan

1. **Acknowledge Encore's Role**
   - Document how Encore Cloud handles infrastructure auto-scaling for services and databases
   - Note that direct implementation of database sharding or low-level auto-scaling rules is abstracted by Encore

2. **Focus on Application-Level Contributions to Scalability**
   - Design stateless services aligned with Encore's microservice principles for horizontal scaling
   - Document how the caching strategy (Task 14.1) and query optimization (Task 14.2) contribute to scalability

3. **Create Documentation (`docs/scalability-strategy.md`)**
   - Describe Encore's scalability model (automated provisioning, microservices, managed databases)
   - Detail application design for scalability through stateless services, caching, and query optimization
   - Explain database scalability approach (logical schema with Drizzle, physical scaling managed by Encore)
   - Include considerations for self-hosted Encore deployments

4. **No Direct Code Implementation for Auto-Scaling Rules**
   - Focus on documentation and architectural approach rather than implementing auto-scaling mechanisms directly

This task primarily results in documentation that reflects the architectural approach with Encore, acknowledging that many traditional scaling concerns are handled by the platform.

## 4. Performance Testing and SLA Compliance [done]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3
### Description: Develop and execute comprehensive performance tests to ensure SLA compliance
### Details:
Create test scenarios simulating high-traffic conditions, measure response times against SLA requirements, identify bottlenecks, tune database parameters, and implement monitoring solutions to track ongoing performance metrics.

# Performance Testing and SLA Compliance Plan

## 1. Define Performance Test Scenarios & Metrics
- **Chat Response Time (<3s p95/p99)**
  - Scenario: Concurrent users sending chat messages with varying complexity and RAG utilization
  - Metric: End-to-end response time for `/chat/message` API
- **Document Processing Time (<5min average/p95)**
  - Scenario: Upload documents of various sizes and types
  - Metric: Time from `uploadFile` completion to document status "processed"
- **Concurrent Users (100+)**
  - Scenario: Multiple users performing mixed actions (chat, document listing/viewing, uploads)
  - Metrics: API error rates, average response times, system resource utilization

## 2. Tooling for Performance Testing
- Utilize k6 or Artillery for API load testing
- Initial focus on defining test cases rather than full script implementation

## 3. Bottleneck Identification & Tuning Strategy
- Leverage Encore's observability features (tracing, logging, metrics) to analyze test results
- Identify performance bottlenecks such as slow database queries or service contention
- Optimize parameters within Encore's management scope or influence (cache configurations, database optimizations)

## 4. Documentation
- Create `docs/performance-testing-strategy.md` containing:
  - Defined test scenarios, metrics, and SLA targets
  - Approach for tooling, bottleneck identification, and tuning
  - Integration with Encore's observability for performance monitoring

## 5. Primary Outcome
- Deliver comprehensive performance testing strategy documentation
- Note that full execution and iterative tuning of load tests will be addressed in subsequent efforts
