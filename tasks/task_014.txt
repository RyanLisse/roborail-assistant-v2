# Task ID: 14
# Title: Optimize Performance and Scalability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize system for performance and scalability targets.
# Details:
Implement multi-level caching, query optimization, and auto-scaling. Monitor and tune for <3s chat response, <5min document processing, and 100+ concurrent users.

# Test Strategy:
Test performance under load, response times, and scalability. Validate SLA compliance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Multi-level Caching Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a multi-level caching strategy to reduce database load and improve response times
### Details:
Configure buffer pools and memory caches, optimize cache parameters based on traffic patterns, and implement distributed caching for high-traffic scenarios. Focus on efficient memory utilization and alignment with system requirements.

## 2. Query Optimization for Key Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze and optimize critical database queries to improve performance
### Details:
Perform query plan analysis, implement proper indexing strategies, rewrite complex queries, and apply appropriate optimization techniques (cost-based, rule-based, or heuristic-based) based on query complexity. Focus on columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.

## 3. Auto-scaling Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2
### Description: Implement database sharding and partitioning with auto-scaling capabilities
### Details:
Design horizontal and vertical partitioning strategies, implement effective sharding for large databases, configure partition pruning, and set up auto-scaling rules based on performance metrics and traffic patterns.

## 4. Performance Testing and SLA Compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3
### Description: Develop and execute comprehensive performance tests to ensure SLA compliance
### Details:
Create test scenarios simulating high-traffic conditions, measure response times against SLA requirements, identify bottlenecks, tune database parameters, and implement monitoring solutions to track ongoing performance metrics.
