# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Core Infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize project repository with core infrastructure for backend (EncoreTS), frontend (Next.js), and CI/CD pipelines.
# Details:
Create monorepo or separate repos for backend and frontend. Set up EncoreTS for backend services, Next.js with Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS for frontend. Configure CI/CD for automated testing and deployment. Initialize linting, formatting, and commit hooks. Set up local, preview, and production environments.

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository structure, CI/CD pipeline, and environment setup. Run initial linting and formatting checks.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Repository Structure Creation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and create the foundational directory structure for the monorepo, including separate folders for backend, frontend, shared resources, and configuration files.
### Details:
Establish a clear and scalable folder hierarchy to support both EncoreTS backend and Next.js frontend. Include placeholders for CI/CD and environment configuration files.

## 2. Backend EncoreTS Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Initialize the EncoreTS backend, define core services, and set up API endpoints using Encore's conventions.
### Details:
Use the Encore CLI to scaffold the backend, create service folders with `encore.service.ts`, and define initial API endpoints. Ensure type-safe resource definitions and prepare for future expansion.

## 3. Frontend Next.js Setup with UI Components [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up the Next.js frontend application and establish a reusable UI component library.
### Details:
Initialize a Next.js project in the designated frontend folder. Create a basic page structure and implement a shared UI components directory for consistent design.

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Configure automated build, test, and deployment pipelines for both backend and frontend using a CI/CD tool (e.g., GitHub Actions).
### Details:
Set up workflows to lint, test, and deploy both EncoreTS and Next.js apps. Ensure pipelines are modular and support multi-environment deployments.

## 5. Environment Configuration for All Deployment Stages [done]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Establish environment variable management and configuration files for development, staging, and production.
### Details:
Create and document `.env` files or use a secrets manager for each environment. Ensure both backend and frontend can securely access required configuration values.
