# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Monitoring and Observability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up custom metrics, structured logging, and error tracking.
# Details:
Instrument services for custom metrics (processing time, embedding time, RAG scores, LLM response time, cache hit rates). Implement structured logging and error reporting. Integrate with Encore dashboard for real-time monitoring.

# Test Strategy:
Test metric collection, logging, and dashboard integration. Validate error tracking and alerting.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Custom Metrics Instrumentation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add application-level metrics to all microservices using OpenTelemetry or Prometheus client libraries
### Details:
Identify key performance indicators and business metrics for each service. Instrument code with counters, gauges, and histograms to track metrics like response times, error rates, and business-specific measurements. Focus on metrics that provide quantitative measurements of system health and can detect anomalies. Include metrics for latency of transactions, database connections, cache hit/miss ratios, and resource utilization.

## 2. Set Up Structured Logging and Error Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Implement consistent structured logging patterns across all services with contextual information
### Details:
Design a standardized logging format that includes timestamps, service names, trace IDs, and severity levels. Ensure logs provide detailed context on events within the system, including errors, warnings, and informational messages. Configure log aggregation to a central location. Implement error reporting mechanisms that capture stack traces and relevant context. Ensure logs can be correlated with metrics for comprehensive troubleshooting.

## 3. Integrate Real-time Monitoring Dashboards [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Create comprehensive dashboards that visualize metrics and logs from all services
### Details:
Select and configure a dashboard solution compatible with your metrics and logging systems. Design dashboards that display key metrics, service health, and business KPIs. Set up alerts for critical thresholds. Create views for different stakeholders (developers, operations, business). Ensure dashboards provide real-time visibility into system performance and can help identify bottlenecks. Include visualizations for custom metrics that track specific values from services and systems.
